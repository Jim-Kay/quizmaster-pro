Quickstart
==========

Build your first AI agent with CrewAI in under 5 minutes.

[​](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart#build-your-first-crewai-agent)

Build your first CrewAI Agent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s create a simple crew that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments` for a given topic or subject.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `crewai` and `crewai-tools` installed. If you haven’t installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](https://docs.crewai.com/installation).

Follow the steps below to get crewing! 🚣‍♂️

1

Create your crew

Create a new crew project by running the following command in your terminal. This will create a new directory called `latest-ai-development` with the basic structure for your crew.

2

Modify your \`agents.yaml\` file

You can also modify the agents as needed to fit your use case or copy and paste as is to your project. Any variable interpolated in your `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files like `{topic}` will be replaced by the value of the variable in the `main.py` file.

agents.yaml

```yaml
# src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: >
    {topic} Senior Data Researcher
  goal: >
    Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
  backstory: >
    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

reporting_analyst:
  role: >
    {topic} Reporting Analyst
  goal: >
    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
    your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
    it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
```

3

Modify your \`tasks.yaml\` file

tasks.yaml

```yaml
# src/latest_ai_development/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
    Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
    the current year is 2024.
  expected_output: >
    A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
  agent: researcher

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
```

4

Modify your \`crew.py\` file

crew.py

```python
# src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  @agent
  def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
      verbose=True,
      tools=[SerperDevTool()]
    )

  @agent
  def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
      verbose=True
    )

  @task
  def research_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
    )

  @task
  def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
      output_file='output/report.md' # This is the file that will be contain the final report.
    )

  @crew
  def crew(self) -> Crew:
    """Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
    return Crew(
      agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
      tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
      process=Process.sequential,
      verbose=True,
    )
```

5

\[Optional\] Add before and after crew functions

crew.py

```python
# src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task, before_kickoff, after_kickoff
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  @before_kickoff
  def before_kickoff_function(self, inputs):
    print(f"Before kickoff function with inputs: {inputs}")
    return inputs # You can return the inputs or modify them as needed

  @after_kickoff
  def after_kickoff_function(self, result):
    print(f"After kickoff function with result: {result}")
    return result # You can return the result or modify it as needed

  # ... remaining code
```

6

Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew

For example, you can pass the `topic` input to your crew to customize the research and reporting.

main.py

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/latest_ai_development/main.py
import sys
from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

def run():
  """
  Run the crew.
  """
  inputs = {
    'topic': 'AI Agents'
  }
  LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

7

Set your environment variables

Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:

*   An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
*   A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`

8

Lock and install the dependencies

Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:

9

Run your crew

To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:

10

View your final report

You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the final report.

Here’s an example of what the report should look like:

### 

[​](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart#note-on-consistency-in-naming)

Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code. For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file. This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won’t recognize the reference properly.

#### 

[​](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart#example-references)

Example References

Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.

agents.yaml

```yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: mixtal_llm
```

Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.

tasks.yaml

```yaml
email_summarizer_task:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_task
      - research_task
```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the `crew.py` file.

### 

[​](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart#annotations-include)

Annotations include:

*   `@agent`
*   `@task`
*   `@crew`
*   `@tool`
*   `@before_kickoff`
*   `@after_kickoff`
*   `@callback`
*   `@output_json`
*   `@output_pydantic`
*   `@cache_handler`

crew.py

```python
# ...
@agent
def email_summarizer(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["email_summarizer"],
    )

@task
def email_summarizer_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["email_summarizer_task"],
    )
# ...
```

In addition to the [sequential process](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/sequential-process), you can use the [hierarchical process](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/hierarchical-process), which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. You can learn more about the core concepts [here](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts).

### 

[​](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart#replay-tasks-from-latest-crew-kickoff)

Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

```shell
crewai replay <task_id>
```

Replace `<task_id>` with the ID of the task you want to replay.

### 

[​](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart#reset-crew-memory)

Reset Crew Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:

```shell
crewai reset-memories --all
```

This will clear the crew’s memory, allowing for a fresh start.
