# Assessments Style Guide

## Overview
This guide provides rules to prevent learners from selecting incorrect answers due to confusion over style rather than lack of knowledge. The goal is to ensure clarity and consistency across assessments.

The guide adheres to the **Google Developer Documentation Style Guide (GDD Style Guide)**, which references **Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary** and **The Chicago Manual of Style**.

### Key Sections of the GDD Style Guide
- General principles (style and tone)
- Language and grammar
- Punctuation
- Formatting and organization
- Computer interfaces
- HTML and CSS
- Names and naming conventions

---

## Exceptions/Additions to the GDD Style Guide

### Acronyms and Abbreviations
- Provide the full term the first time an acronym is mentioned unless it is commonly known.
- Avoid using "i.e." or "e.g."; use "for example" instead.
- Avoid using "etc."; use "and more" instead.
- Do not spell out acronyms that are part of product or feature names.

**Examples:**
- YES: International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2) is a standards organization.
- NO: ISC2 is a standards organization.

---

### Pronouns and Perspective
- Use **second person ("you")** in assessments.
- Establish the role of "you" in scenarios.
- Use **"they"** for third-person references.

**Examples:**
- YES: You are a security analyst and you discover a breach. What would you do next?
- NO: A security analyst finds a breach. What should he or she do next?

---

### Words and Terms to Avoid
- Avoid complex phrases. Replace with simpler alternatives:
  - "Leverage" → "Use"
  - "In order to" → "To"
  - "Since" → "Because"
  - "Like" → "Such as"
  - "Impact" → "Effect/Affect"
  - "Space" → "Market"
  - "Environment" → More specific word

---

### Style Guidance
- Use present tense and active voice.
- Questions should be future-proof (avoid terms like "latest").
- Use:
  - "Ensure" for making sure.
  - "Insure" for insurance arrangements.
  - "Assure" for convincing someone.
- Treat organizations as singular entities:
  - YES: An organization monitors its users.
  - NO: An organization monitors their users.
